<h1>📺 Netflix Business Case Study | Exploratory Data Analytics & Visualization</h1>

<p>
As part of a guided analytics project, I explored Netflix’s content strategy using real-world data and Python.
The focus was on cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing key patterns across content types, genres, ratings, and global presence.
</p>

<h2>🔍 Key Highlights:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Cleaned and prepared Netflix dataset using <code>pandas</code> (handled null values, corrected formats, split duration by type)</li>
  <li>Explored and visualized trends in content addition by year, month, and week using <code>Matplotlib</code> and <code>Seaborn</code></li>
  <li>Identified top content-producing countries for both movies and TV shows, revealing Netflix's regional content strength</li>
  <li>Analyzed popular genres and ratings, showing a focus on drama, international content, and mature audiences</li>
  <li>Studied movie durations and TV show season counts to understand content length patterns</li>
  <li>Extracted top actors and directors, and visualized insights using word clouds and bar plots</li>
  <li>Evaluated best months/weeks to release content, based on user trends and seasonal activity</li>
  <li>Applied business reasoning using data to suggest opportunities for Netflix in kids' content and regional TV shows</li>
</ul>

<p>
This project sharpened my expertise in data wrangling, visual storytelling, and business analytics,
bridging the gap between raw data and strategic insight—skills I continuously apply in data-driven roles.
